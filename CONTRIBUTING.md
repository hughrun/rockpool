Thanks for being interested in contributing to Rockpool!

# Reporting a bug

If you have found a bug (something that is broken, throws an error message, or seems to behave weirdly) **please file a bug report** by clicking _New Issue_ in [Issues](https://github.com/hughrun/rockpool/issues). Bug reports are super useful! Use the _Bug Report_ template and provide as much information as possible.

# Reporting missing, confusing or misleading documentation

This is a common problem in open source software and it annoys me too. I want Rockpool to be easy to use with great documentation.

If you're not sure what the documentation should say, but think there's a problem, log an [issue](https://github.com/hughrun/rockpool/issues) using the _Documentation_ template.
If you would like to contribute by improving the documentation, please also log an issue but indicate in it that you're happy to update it. We can have a chat about the easiest way for you to do that, which may end up as a pull request, depending on what suits your workflow.

# Suggesting a new feature

Got an idea for a cool feature? Log a new [issue](https://github.com/hughrun/rockpool/issues) using the _Feature Request_ template.

# Pull requests

Please do _not_ make pull requests without having logged an issue and had a conversation about it first. Random pull requests are very unlikely to be merged.
