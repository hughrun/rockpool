# Rockpool

Support a community and store what you need from the ocean of information.

Successor to and complete rewrite of [CommunityTweets](https://github.com/hughrun/CommunityTweets).

Rockpool is an Express app interfacing with MongoDB to provide:

* harvesting of article metadata via RSS and storage in MongoDB
* web interface to discover articles via search or tag browse
* announcements of new articles via Twitter and/or Mastodon
* subscription to all articles via Pocket or RSS
* self-registration of blogs by owners
* admin access to approve and edit blog listings
* editing of blog listings by verified owners

Work In Progress: **Definitely not production-ready yet!**
