# Browse

The browse page allows users to browse the whole list of blogs.

If you are logged in, you will see an 'Actions' button to the right of each blog. This will allow the following actions:

## Claim a blog

This action is only available when the `legacy_db` setting is set to `true`. If your app uses a 'legacy database' (this will probably only apply to _Aus GLAM Blogs_) you will be able to "claim" a blog. 

This function exists because in the previous version of the app there were no ownership details stored with each blog listing, except in some cases a Twitter account. Once your claim is accepted, you will be the 'owner' of the blog and everything will work just like if you registered it from scratch. 

You will not be able to claim a blog you already own.

## Exclude a blog from Pocket

This action is only available when you have registered a Pocket account either from the user dashboard or the subscribe page. You can choose to exclude particular blogs from being added to your Pocket list. If you have already excluded a blog, the action available will be 'Include blog in Pocket' which reverses the process - essentially it's an "undo" option.

If there are no actions available, you will simply not see the 'actions' button.
